description: "Probably the most challenging beginner route in this boulder. Sit start and double start with left hand on a sloper, right hand on a slopery crimp. There is a good sharp jug above your hand hand start hold, and right hand with a pinch hold on the same level. Once you get the right hand pinch, you can switch your left hand to a sidepull. Stand up and find a good sloper above and match hand on it. Then you can top out with the remaining good holds."
